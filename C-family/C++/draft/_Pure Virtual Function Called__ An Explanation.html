      Summary
    </div>"Pure virtual function called" is the dying message of
    the occasional crashed C++ program. What does it mean? You can
    find a couple of simple, well-documented explanations out there
    that apply to problems easy to diagnose during postmortem
    debugging. There is also another rather subtle bug that
    generates the same message. If you have a mysterious crash
    associated with that message, it might well mean your program
    went indirect on a dangling pointer. This article covers all
    these explanations.
  </div>
<!-- BOTTOM OF SUMMARY -->
  <h1>Object-Oriented C++: The Programmer's View</h1>
  <p>(If you know what pure virtual functions and abstract classes
  are, you can skip this section.)</p>
  <p>In C++, virtual functions let instances of related classes
  have different behavior at run time (aka, <em>runtime
  polymorphism</em>) :</p>
  <pre class="indent">class Shape {
public:
        virtual double area() const;
        double value() const;
        // Meyers 3rd Item 7:
        virtual ~Shape();
protected:
        Shape(double valuePerSquareUnit);
private:
        double valuePerSquareUnit_;
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
        Rectangle(double width, double height, double valuePerSquareUnit);
        virtual double area() const;
        // Meyers 3rd Item 7:
        virtual ~Rectangle();
// ...
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
        Circle(double radius, double valuePerSquareUnit);
        virtual double area() const;
        // Meyers 3rd Item 7:
        virtual ~Circle();
// ...
};

double
Shape::value() const
{
        // Area is computed differently, depending
        // on what kind of shape the object is:
        return valuePerSquareUnit_ * area();
}
</pre>
  <p>(The comments before the destructors refer to Item 7 in the
  third edition of Scott Meyers's <i>Effective C++</i>: "Declare
  destructors virtual in polymorphic base classes." This code
  follows a convention used on several projects, where references
  like this are put in the code, serving as reminders to
  maintainers and reviewers. To some people, the point is obvious
  and the reminder is distracting; but one person's distraction is
  another person's helpful hint, and programmers in a hurry often
  forget what should be "obvious.")</p>
  <p>In C++, a function's interface is specified by declaring the
  function. Member functions are declared in the class definition.
  A function's implementation is specified by defining the
  function. Derived classes can redefine a function, specifying an
  implementation particular to that derived class (and classes
  derived from <i>it</i>). When a virtual function is called, the
  implementation is chosen based not on the static type of the
  pointer or reference, but on the type of the object being pointed
  to, which can vary at run time:</p>
  <pre class="indent">print(shape-&gt;area());  // Might invoke Circle::area() or Rectangle::area().
</pre>
  <p>A <em>pure</em> virtual function is declared, but not
  necessarily defined, by a base class. A class with a pure virtual
  function is "abstract" (as opposed to "concrete"), in that it's
  not possible to create instances of that class. A derived class
  must define all inherited pure virtual functions of its base
  classes to be concrete.</p>
  <pre class="indent">class AbstractShape {
public:
        virtual double area() const = 0;
        double value() const;
        // Meyers 3rd Item 7:
        virtual ~AbstractShape();
protected:
        AbstractShape(double valuePerSquareUnit);
private:
        double valuePerSquareUnit_;
protected:
        AbstractShape(double valuePerSquareUnit);
private:
        double valuePerSquareUnit_;
};

// Circle and Rectangle are derived from AbstractShape.

// This will not compile, even if there's a matching public constructor:
// AbstractShape* p = new AbstractShape(value);

// These are okay:
Rectangle* pr = new Rectangle(height, weight, value);
Circle* pc = new Circle(radius, value);

// These are okay, too:
AbstractShape* p = pr;
p = pc;

</pre>
  <h1>Object Oriented C++: Under the Covers</h1>
  <p>(You can skip this section if you already know what a "vtbl"
  is.)</p>
  <p>How does all this run time magic happen? The usual
  implementation is, every class with any virtual functions has an
  array of function pointers, called a "vtbl". Every instance of
  such as class has a pointer to its class's <em>vtbl</em>, as
  depicted below.</p>
  <center>
    <img src="./_Pure Virtual Function Called__ An Explanation_files/pure_virtual_fig_1.png">
    <p><strong>Figure 1. A class's vtbl points to the class's
    instance member functions.</strong></p>
  </center>
  <p>If an abstract class with a pure virtual function doesn't
  define the function, what goes in the corresponding place in the
  <em>vtbl</em>? Traditionally, C++ implementors have provided a
  special function, which prints "Pure virtual function called" (or
  words to that effect), and then crashes the program.</p>
  <center>
    <img src="./_Pure Virtual Function Called__ An Explanation_files/pure_virtual_fig_2.png">
    <p><strong>Figure 2. An abstract class's vtbl can have a
    pointer to a special function.</strong></p>
  </center>
  <h1>Build 'em Up, Tear 'em Down</h1>
  <p>When you construct an instance of a derived class, what
  happens, exactly? If the class has a <em>vtbl</em>, the process
  goes something like the following.</p>
  <p>Step 1: Construct the top-level base part:.</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Make the instance point to the base class's
    <em>vtbl</em>.</li>
    <li>Construct the base class instance member variables.</li>
    <li>Execute the body of the base class constructor.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Step 2: Construct the derived part(s) (recursively):</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Make the instance point to the derived class's
    <em>vtbl</em>.</li>
    <li>Construct the derived class instance member variables.</li>
    <li>Execute the body of the derived class constructor.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Destruction happens in reverse order, something like this:</p>
  <p>Step 1: Destruct the derived part:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>(The instance already points to the derived class's
    <em>vtbl</em>.)</li>
    <li>Execute the body of the derived class destructor.</li>
    <li>Destruct the derived class instance member variables.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Step 2: Destruct the base part(s) (recursively):</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Make the instance point to the base class's vtbl.</li>
    <li>Execute the body of the base class destructor.</li>
    <li>Destruct the base class instance member variables.</li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Two of the Classic Blunders</h1>
  <p>What if you try to call a virtual function from a base class
  constructor?</p>
  <pre class="indent">// From sample program 1:
AbstractShape(double valuePerSquareUnit)
        : valuePerSquareUnit_(valuePerSquareUnit)
{
        // ERROR: Violation of Meyers 3rd Item 9!
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "creating shape, area = " &lt;&lt; area() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</pre>
  <p>(Meyers, 3rd edition, Item 9: "Never call virtual functions
  during construction or destruction.")</p>
  <p>This is obviously an attempt to call a pure virtual function.
  The compiler could alert us to this problem, and some compilers
  do. If a base class destructor calls a pure virtual function
  directly (sample program 2), you have essentially the same
  situation.</p>
  <p>If the situation is a little more complicated, the error will
  be less obvious (and the compiler is less likely to help us):</p>
  <pre class="indent">// From sample program 3:
AbstractShape::AbstractShape(double valuePerSquareUnit)
        : valuePerSquareUnit_(valuePerSquareUnit)
{
        // ERROR: Indirect violation of Meyers 3rd Item 9!
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "creating shape, value = " &lt;&lt; value() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</pre>
  <p>The body of this base class constructor is in step 1(c) of the
  construction process described above, which calls a instance
  member function (<code>value()</code>), which in turn calls a
  pure virtual function (<code>area()</code>). The object is still
  an AbstractShape at this point. What happens when it tries to
  call the pure virtual function? Your program likely crashes with
  a message similar to, "Pure virtual function called."</p>
  <p>Similarly, calling a virtual function indirectly from a base
  class destructor (sample program 4) results in the same kind of
  crash. The same goes for passing a partially-constructed (or
  partially-destructed) object to any function that invokes virtual
  functions.</p>
  <p>These are the most commonly described root causes of the "Pure
  Virtual Function Called" message. They're straightforward to
  diagnose from postmortem debugging; the stack trace will point
  clearly to the problem.</p>
  <h1>Pointing Out Blame</h1>
  <p>There's at least one other problem that can lead to this
  message, which doesn't seem to be explicitly described anywhere
  in print or on the net. (There have been some discussions on the
  ACE mailing list that touch upon the problem but they don't go
  into detail.)</p>
  <p>Consider the following (buggy) code:</p>
  <pre class="indent">        // From sample program 5:
        AbstractShape* p1 = new Rectangle(width, height, valuePerSquareUnit);
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "value = " &lt;&lt; p1-&gt;value() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        AbstractShape* p2 = p1;  // Need another copy of the pointer.
        delete p1;
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "now value = " &lt;&lt; p2-&gt;value() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</pre>
  <p>Let's consider these lines one at a time.</p>
  <pre class="indent">        AbstractShape* p1 = new Rectangle(width, height, valuePerSquareUnit);
</pre>
  <p>A new object is created. It's constructed in two stages: Step
  1, where the object acts like a base class instance, and Step 2,
  where it acts like a derived class instance.</p>
  <pre class="indent">        std::cout &lt;&lt; "value = " &lt;&lt; p1-&gt;value() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</pre>
  <p>Everything's working fine.</p>
  <pre class="indent">        AbstractShape* p2 = p1;  // Need another copy of the pointer.
</pre>
  <p>Something odd might happen to <code>p1</code>, so let's make a
  copy of it.</p>
  <pre class="indent">        delete p1;
</pre>
  <p>The object is destructed in two stages: Step 1, where the
  object acts like a derived class instance, and Step 2, where it
  acts like a base class instance.</p>
  <p>Note that the value of <code>p1</code> might change after the
  call to <code>delete</code>. Compilers are allowed to "zero out"
  (i.e., render unusable) pointers after destructing their
  pointed-to data. Lucky (?) for us, we have another copy of the
  pointer, <code>p2</code>, which didn't change.</p>
  <pre class="indent">        std::cout &lt;&lt; "now value = " &lt;&lt; p2-&gt;value() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</pre>
  <p>Uh oh.</p>
  <p>This is another classic blunder: going indirect on a
  "dangling" pointer. That's a pointer to an object that's been
  deleted, or memory that's been freed, or both. C++ programmers
  never write such code ... unless they're clueless (unlikely) or
  rushed (all too likely).</p>
  <p>So now <code>p2</code> points to an ex-object. What does that
  thing look like? According to the C++ standard, it's "undefined".
  That's a technical term that means, in theory, anything can
  happen: the program can crash, or keep running but generate
  garbage results, or send Bjarne Stroustrup e-mail saying how ugly
  you are and how funny your mother dresses you. You can't depend
  on anything; the behavior might vary from compiler to compiler,
  or machine to machine, or run to run. In practice, there are
  several common possibilities (which may or may not happen
  consistently):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The memory might be marked as deallocated. Any attempt to
    access it would immediately be flagged as the use of a dangling
    pointer. That's what some tools (BoundsChecker, Purify,
    valgrind, and others) try to do. As we'll see, the Common
    Language Runtime (CLR) from Microsoft's .NET Framework, and Sun
    Studio 11's dbx debugger, work this way.</li>
    <li>The memory might be deliberately scrambled. The memory
    management system might write garbage-like values into the
    memory after it's freed. (One such value is "dead beef":
    0xDEADBEEF, unsigned decimal 3735928559, signed decimal
    -559038737.)</li>
    <li>The memory might be reused. If other code was executed
    between the deletion of the object and the use of dangling
    pointer, the memory allocation system might have created a new
    object out of some or all of the memory used by the old object.
    If you're lucky, this will look enough like garbage that the
    program will crash immediately. Otherwise the program will
    likely crash sometime later, possibly after curdling other
    objects, often long after the root cause problem occurred. This
    is the kind of problem that drives C++ programmers crazy (and
    makes Java programmers overly smug).</li>
    <li>The memory might have been left exactly the way it
    was.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The last is an interesting case. What was the object "exactly
  the way it was"? In this case, it was an instance of the abstract
  base class; certainly that's the way the <em>vtbl</em> was left.
  What happens if we try to call a pure virtual member function for
  such an object?</p>
  <p>"Pure virtual function called".</p>
  <p>(Exercise for the reader: Imagine a function that, unwisely
  and unfortunately, returned a pointer or reference to a local
  variable. This is a different kind of dangling pointer. How could
  this also generate this message?)</p>
  <h1>Meanwhile, Back in the Real World</h1>
  <p>Nice theory. What happens in practice?</p>
  <p>Consider five test programs, each with its own distinctive
  defect:</p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Directly calling a virtual function from a base class
    constructor.</li>
    <li>Directly calling a virtual function from a base class
    destructor.</li>
    <li>Indirectly calling a virtual function from a base class
    constructor.</li>
    <li>Indirectly calling a virtual function from a base class
    destructor.</li>
    <li>Calling a virtual function via a dangling pointer.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>These were built and tested with several compilers (running on
  x86 Windows XP unless stated otherwise):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Visual C++ 8.0</li>
    <li>Digital Mars C/C++ compiler version 8.42n</li>
    <li>Open Watcom C/C++ version 1.4</li>
    <li>SPARC Solaris 10, Sun Studio 11</li>
    <li>gcc:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>x86 Linux (Red Hat 3.2), gcc 2.96 / 3.0 / 3.2.2</li>
      <li>x86 Windows XP (Cygwin), gcc 3.4.4</li>
      <li>SPARC Solaris 8, gcc 3.2.2</li>
      <li>PowerPC Mac OS X.4 (Tiger), gcc 3.3 / 4.0</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h1>Direct Invocation</h1>
  <p>Some compilers recognized what was happening in the first two
  examples, with various results.</p>
  <p>Visual C++ 8.0, Open Watcom C/C++ 1.4, and gcc 4.x recognize
  that a base class's constructor or destructor can't possibly
  invoke a derived class's member function. As a result, these
  compilers optimize away any runtime polymorphism, and treat the
  call as an invocation of the base class member function. If that
  member function is not defined, the program doesn't link. If the
  member function is defined, the program runs without problems.
  gcc 4.x produces a warning ("abstract virtual 'virtual double
  AbstractShape::area() const' called from constructor" for the
  first program, and similarly for the destructor for the second
  program). Visual C++ 8.0 built the programs without any
  complaint, even at the maximum warning level (/Wall); similarly
  for Open Watcom C/C++ 1.4.</p>
  <p>gcc 3.x and Digital Mars C/C++ compiler 8.42n rejected these
  programs, complaining, respectively, "abstract virtual `virtual
  double AbstractShape::area() const' called from constructor" (or
  "from destructor") and "Error: 'AbstractShape::area' is a pure
  virtual function".</p>
  <p>Sun Studio 11 produced a warning, "Warning: Attempt to call a
  pure virtual function AbstractShape::area() const will always
  fail", but builds the programs. As promised, both crash, with the
  message, "Pure virtual function called".</p>
  <h1>Indirect Invocation</h1>
  <p>The next two examples built without warning for all compilers.
  (That's to be expected; this is not the kind of problem normally
  caught by static analysis.) The resulting programs all crashed,
  with various error messages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Visual C++ 8.0: "R6025 - pure virtual function call
    (__vftpr[0] == __purecall)".</li>
    <li>Digital Mars C/C++ compiler 8.42n: did not generate an
    error message when the program crashed. (That's fine; this is
    "undefined" behavior, and the compiler is free to do whatever
    it wants.)</li>
    <li>Open Watcom C/C++ 1.4: "pure virtual function
    called!".</li>
    <li>Sun Studio 11: "Pure virtual function called" (same as for
    the first two programs).</li>
    <li>gcc: "pure virtual method called".</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Invocation via a Dangling Pointer</h1>
  <p>The fifth example in the previous list always built without
  warning and crashed when run. Again, this is to be expected. For
  all compilers except Microsoft's, the error message was the same
  as for the third and fourth examples. Sun's compiler generated
  the same message, but Sun's debugger provided some additional
  information.</p>
  <p>Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0 has a number of runtime libraries.
  Each handles this error in its own way.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Win32 console application:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>When run without the debugger, the program crashes
      silently.</li>
      <li>When run in the debugger, a program built in debug mode
      generates the message, "Unhandled exception ... Access
      violation reading location 0xfeeefeee." This is clearly "dead
      beef" behavior; when memory was freed, the runtime overwrote
      it with garbage.</li>
      <li>When built in release mode and run in the debugger, the
      program produces the message, "Unhandled exception ...
      Illegal Instruction".</li>
    </ul>
    <li>CLR console application:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>When built in debug mode, the message is, "Attempted to
      read or write protected memory. This is often an indication
      that other memory is corrupt." The debug runtime system has
      marked the freed memory, and terminates the program when it
      tries to use that memory.</li>
      <li>When built in release mode, the program crashes with the
      message, "Object reference not set to an instance of an
      object."</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>When compiled with Sun Studio 11, and run in dbx with Run-Time
  Checking, the program died with an new error: "Read from
  unallocated (rua): Attempting to read 4 bytes at address 0x486a8
  which is 48 bytes before heap block of size 40 bytes at 0x486d8".
  This is the debugger's way of saying, "You just used something in
  a block of memory, but this isn't a block of memory I think you
  should be using." Once the object was destructed and its memory
  deallocated, the program could no longer (legally) use that
  object, or that memory, again.</p>
  <h1>Owning Up</h1>
  <p>How can you avoid these kind of problems?</p>
  <p>It's easy for the problems in the first four example programs.
  Pay attention to Scott Meyers, and (for the first two examples)
  pay attention to any warning messages you get.</p>
  <p>What about the "dangling pointer" problem in the fifth
  example? Programmers, in any language, need to design in terms of
  object ownership. Something (or some collection of things) owns
  an object. Ownership might be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>transferred to something else (or some other collection of
    things), or</li>
    <li>"loaned" without transferring ownership, or</li>
    <li>shared, by using reference counts or garbage
    collection.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What kind of "thing" can own an object?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Another object, obviously.</li>
    <li>A collection of objects; for example, all the smart
    pointers that point to the owned object.</li>
    <li>A function. When a function is called, it may assume
    ownership (transferred) or not (loaned). Functions always own
    their local variables, but not necessarily what those local
    variables point or refer to.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In our example, there was no clear ownership. Some function
  created an object, and pointed two pointers at it. Who owns the
  object? Probably the function, in which case, it should be
  responsible for avoiding the problem somehow. It could have used
  one "dumb" pointer (and explicitly zeroed it out after deletion)
  instead of two, or used some sort of smart pointers.</p>
  <p>In real life, it's never that simple, except sometimes in
  retrospect. Objects can be passed from one module to one very
  different module, written by other person or another
  organization. Object ownership issues span equally long
  chasms.</p>
  <p>Any time you pass an object around, you always need to know
  the answer to the ownership question. It's a simple issue,
  sometimes with a simple answer, but never a question that
  magically answers itself. There is no substitute for thought.</p>
  <p>Thinking for yourself doesn't mean thinking by yourself,
  however; there is some good existing work that can help you. Tom
  Cargill wrote up a pattern language, "Localized Ownership," that
  describes strategies for these alternatives. Scott Meyers also
  addresses this in Item 13, "Use objects to manage resources," and
  Item 14, "Think carefully about copying behavior in
  resource-managing classes," in the third edition of <i>Effective
  C++</i>. See References for details.</p>
  <h1>No Smart Pointer Panacea</h1>
  <p>Reference-counted smart pointers are very helpful in avoiding
  these kinds of problems. With smart pointers, ownership belongs
  to the set of smart pointers that point to the object. When the
  last such smart pointer stops pointing to that object, the object
  is deleted. That would certainly solve the problem we've seen
  here.</p>
  <p>But many programmers are just beginning to use smart pointers,
  and just beginning to learn how to use them. Even with smart
  pointers, you can still run into these kinds of problems ... if
  you use smart pointers in dumb ways.</p>
  <p>But that's another problem for another day.</p>
