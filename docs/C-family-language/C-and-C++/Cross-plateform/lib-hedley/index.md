## Brief Description

Hedley is C/C++ a header file designed to smooth over some platform-specific annoyances. The idea is to get rid of a bunch of the `#ifdefs` in your code and put them in Hedley instead or, if you haven't bothered with platform-specific functionality in your code, to make it easier to do so.
