# String

## cppreference [string library](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string)

The C++ strings library includes support for three general types of strings:

- [std::basic_string](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string) - a templated class designed to manipulate strings of any character type.
- [std::basic_string_view](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view) (C++17) - a lightweight non-owning read-only view into a subsequence of a string.
- Null-terminated strings - arrays of characters terminated by a special *null* character.

> NOTE: 上述三者是C++语言的string，对于Null-terminated strings，我们将它成为C string，它在`C-and-C++\String\C-string`章节中描述的。
