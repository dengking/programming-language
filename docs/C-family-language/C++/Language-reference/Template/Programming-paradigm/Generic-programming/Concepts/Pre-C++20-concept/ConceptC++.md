# ConceptC++



## 官网: [ConceptC++](http://www.generic-programming.org/languages/conceptcpp/tutorial.html)

This tutorial illustrates how the addition of concepts into C++ makes writing and using templates easier, by improving type-checking and error messages for templates. We follow the methodology of [Generic Programming](http://www.generic-programming.org/), which focuses on starting with a concrete (non-templated) algorithm and then slowly introducing template parameters to make it more generic. If you would like to follow this tutorial with the aid of a **ConceptC++ compiler**, we suggest that you download the most recent version of [ConceptGCC](http://www.generic-programming.org/software/ConceptGCC.html).

> NOTE: conceptC++需要一个特殊的compiler来支持。





### [ConceptGCC](http://www.generic-programming.org/software/ConceptGCC.html)

ConceptGCC is a derivative of the GNU C++ compiler that implements the [ConceptC++](http://www.generic-programming.org/languages/conceptcpp.html) language. ConceptC++ makes programming with C++ templates easier, because the compiler can type-check templates when they are defined, so mistakes show up earlier.
