## wikibooks [More C++ Idioms](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms)

C++ has indeed become too "expert friendly"-- Bjarne Stroustrup, *The Problem with Programming*, Technology Review, Nov 2006.

Stroustrup's saying is true because experts are intimately(密切的) familiar with the **idioms** in the language(一个语言的专家往往非常熟悉这个语言的idiom). With the increase in the idioms a programmer understands, the language becomes friendlier to him or her. The objective of this open content book is to present modern C++ idioms to programmers who have moderate(中等的) level of familiarity with C++, and help elevate(提高) their knowledge so that C++ feels much friendlier to them. It is designed to be an exhaustive(全部的，详细的) catalog of reusable **idioms** that expert C++ programmers often use while programming or designing using C++. This is an effort to capture(集中) their techniques and vocabulary into a single work. This book describes the idioms in a regular format: *Name-Intent-Motivation-Solution-References*, which is succinct(简洁的) and helps speed learning. By their nature(就其性质而言), idioms tend to have appeared in the C++ community and in published work many times. An effort has been made to refer to the original source(s) where possible(我们已尽力在可能的情况下参考原始来源); if you find a reference incomplete or incorrect, please feel free to suggest or make improvements.

The world is invited to catalog(编目) reusable pieces of C++ knowledge (similar to the book on design patterns by GoF). The goal here is to first build an exhaustive catalog of modern C++ idioms and later evolve it into an idiom language(然后将其演变为成语语言), just like a pattern language. Finally, the contents of this book can be redistributed under the terms of the [GNU Free Documentation License](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/GNUFDL).

**Aimed toward:** Anyone with an intermediate level of knowledge in C++ and supported language paradigms

## What is idiom

在`Theory\Design-pattern\Software-design-pattern.md`的`Classification and list`段中的描述是：

> The most basic and low-level patterns are often called *idioms*. They usually apply only to a single programming language.
