# CPPItertools



## github [ryanhaining](https://github.com/ryanhaining)/[cppitertools](https://github.com/ryanhaining/cppitertools)

Range-based for loop add-ons inspired by the Python builtins and itertools library. Like itertools and the Python3 builtins, this library uses lazy evaluation wherever possible.

*Note*: Everything is inside the `iter` namespace.
