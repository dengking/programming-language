The book makes use of and explores a [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) programming technique called [template metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming). While Alexandrescu didn't invent the technique, he has popularized it among programmers. His book contains solutions to practical problems which C++ programmers may face. Several phrases from the book are now used within the C++ community as generic terms: *modern C++* (as opposed to C/C++ style), policy-based design and [typelist](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Typelist&action=edit&redlink=1).

> NOTE: 

All of the code described in the book is freely available in his library [Loki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_(C%2B%2B)).
