# Dart OOP



## Destructor

dart是不支持destructor的，参见:

1、stackoverflow [How to do something before object destruction in Dart?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31645751/how-to-do-something-before-object-destruction-in-dart) # [A](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31645761/10173843)

> This is not supported. There is nothing like a destructor in Dart.
> JS garbage collector doesn't provide a way to implement this.
