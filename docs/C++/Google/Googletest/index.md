## github [google](https://github.com/google)/[googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)

This repository is a merger of the formerly separate **GoogleTest** and **GoogleMock** projects. These were so closely related that it makes sense to maintain and release them together.

### Getting Started

The information for **GoogleTest** is available in the [GoogleTest Primer](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/primer.md) documentation.

**GoogleMock** is an extension to GoogleTest for writing and using C++ mock classes. See the separate [GoogleMock documentation](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock/README.md).
