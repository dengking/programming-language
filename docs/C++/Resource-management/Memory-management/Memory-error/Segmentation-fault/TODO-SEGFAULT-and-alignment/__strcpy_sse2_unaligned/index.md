# `__strcpy_sse2_unaligned`

## Example code

在运行owasp的[Doubly freeing memory](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Doubly_freeing_memory)文章中给出的代码时，发现的这个错误：

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define BUFSIZE1    512
#define BUFSIZE2    ((BUFSIZE1/2) - 8)

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  char *buf1R1;
  char *buf2R1;
  char *buf1R2;

  buf1R1 = (char *) malloc(BUFSIZE2);
  buf2R1 = (char *) malloc(BUFSIZE2);

  free(buf1R1);
  free(buf2R1);

  buf1R2 = (char *) malloc(BUFSIZE1);
  strncpy(buf1R2, argv[1], BUFSIZE1-1);

  free(buf2R1); // double free
  free(buf1R2); 
}

```

编译后，我直接这样运行，没有传入一个argument:

```
./a.out
```

进程直接core了

```bash
(base) [github@VM_0_10_centos drdobbs]$ ./a.out

## 分析

### stackoverflow [strcpy misalignment __strcpy_sse2_unaligned()](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43685987/strcpy-misalignment-strcpy-sse2-unaligned)

> The compiler is unable to determine whether your source and destination `char*` are aligned (usually word or even quad-word aligned) and therefore is backing up to the unaligned yet possibly optimized `strcpy` routine. You'd need to explicitly hint about the missed guess it is doing; otherwise, it'll just give up: unaligned access is often disallowed for SSE or still very slow.
>
> **But**, if you're getting a segfault it is very unlikely it's a library issue (it's a *largely* used function) and it just cannot be due to misalignment. It's much likely your code exhibits undefined behavior somewhere, due to buffer overrun, for example. Check your pointers with `valgrind` or `-fsanitize=address`.





## TODO

这个问题和之前碰到过的收录在有道云笔记`programming language/c family language/alignment/memory access and alignment`中的密切相关。
