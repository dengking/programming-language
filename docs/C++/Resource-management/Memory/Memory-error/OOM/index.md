**Out of memory** (**OOM**) is an often undesired state of computer operation where no additional memory can be allocated for use by programs or the operating system. Such a system will be unable to load any additional programs, and since many programs may load additional data into memory during execution, these will cease(终止) to function correctly. This usually occurs because all available memory, including disk [swap space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_space), has been allocated.
