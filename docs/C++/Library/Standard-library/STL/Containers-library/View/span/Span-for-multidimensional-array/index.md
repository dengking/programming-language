# Span-for-multidimensional-array



## stackoverflow [CPPCoreGuidelines span for a T** interface?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41880770/cppcoreguidelines-spant-for-a-t-interface)

In digital signal processing audio is commonly passed around as a 2D array of channels and samples i.e.

```cpp
void use(float** buffer, int channels, int samples) { ... }
```

A lot of libraries I use expect this format.

In terms of my own code, for safer manipulation, is there a way I could use `gsl::span<T>` to set up views on these buffers?

(I understand 1D but I'm not sure how I would set up for a 2D `float**` array)

Thanks in advance.

Use `gsl::multispan` (not well documented) â€“ [Galik](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3807729/galik) Jan 26 '17 at 19:25



## stackoverflow [What is gsl::multi_span to be used for?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45201524/what-is-gslmulti-span-to-be-used-for)

The C++ core guidelines mention spans, not "multi-spans". But - I see that Microsoft's GSL implementation has a [`multi_span` class](https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL/blob/master/include/gsl/multi_span)

```c++
template <
    typename ValueType,
    std::ptrdiff_t FirstDimension,
    std::ptrdiff_t... RestDimensions
>
class multi_span { ... };
```

So, obviously this is some sort of a multi-dimensional version of `gsl::span`. But what is that supposed to mean? Why do we need this multi-dimensional span, or rather - when would we use it? I can't seem to find any documentation on this.

### A

In short, it is a span over contiguous piece of memory, which represents multidimensional array.

Here is an example of use:

```c++
int data[6] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
multi_span<int, 2, 3> span{data, 6};
std::cout << span[1][1] << '\n'; //Outputs 4
```

From the linked source, it seems, that it also supports runtime bounds, but I am not sure about proper syntax for those.

## library [nitronoid](https://github.com/nitronoid)/**[multi_span](https://github.com/nitronoid/multi_span)**

```C++
#include <stdex/multi_span>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <numeric>

int main()
{
	using namespace std;
	/*
	 * Print a vector as a 2D matrix
	 */

	// Define a vector
	vector<int> arr = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 };

	// Create a 2D-view over the vector
	stdex::multi_span<int, 3, 4> my_view(arr);

	// Print all elements of the vector, via the view
	printf("2D view:\n");
	for (int r = 0; r < my_view.extent<0>(); ++r)
	{
		for (int c = 0; c < my_view.extent<1>(); ++c)
		{
			printf("%d ", my_view(r, c));
		}
		printf("\n");
	}
	printf("\n");

	/*
	 * Sum the elements within a sliding 2D sub-view
	 */

	// Define the size of the sub-view
	auto const wsize = 2;
	// Obtain the bounds of our 2D-view
	auto const range = my_view.bounds();

	// Use static_bounds as counting iterators
	using counting_iter = stdex::static_bounds<stdex::dynamic_range, stdex::dynamic_range>;
	// Create a lazy 2D iterable sequence
	counting_iter bnds( { range[0] - wsize + 1, range[1] - wsize + 1 });

	// Iterate through the sequence, obtaining a 2D-coordinate
	for_each(begin(bnds), end(bnds), [&](auto idx)
	{
		// Obtain a sub-view of our main view
					auto const section = my_view.section(idx,
									{	wsize, wsize});
					// Print all elements in the sub-view
					copy(begin(section), end(section), ostream_iterator<int>(cout, " "));
					// Iterate over the sub-view and sum the elements within
					auto const total = accumulate(begin(section), end(section), 0);
					// Print the total
					printf(": sums to %d.\n", total);
				});
	printf("\n");

	return 0;
}
