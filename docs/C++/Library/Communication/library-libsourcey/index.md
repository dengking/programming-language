LibSourcey is a collection of cross platform C++14 modules and classes that provide developers with an arsenal(军火库、装备库) for rapidly developing high performance network based p2p and media streaming applications. Think of it as the power and performance of `libuv` combined with the features of `FFmpeg`, `OpenCV` and `WebRTC`, all integrated with the ease and readability of the `stl` (C++ Standard Library).
