# 7 Designing lock-free concurrent data structures

In this chapter we’ll look at how the memory-ordering properties of the atomic operations introduced in chapter 5 can be used to build lock-free data structures. You need to take extreme care when designing such data structures, because they’re hard to get right, and the conditions that cause the design to fail may occur very rarely. We’ll start by looking at what it means for data structures to be lock-free; then we’ll move on to the reasons for using them before working through some examples and drawing out some general guidelines.
