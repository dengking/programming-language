# swap

一、这是非常重要的operation

二、在下面文章中，对`swap`有着非常好的描述

1、open-std [P1144R2 Object relocation in terms of move plus destroy](http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2019/p1144r2.html)

> analogous to the existing verb "swap," which is equivalent to a move, two move-assignments, and a destroy

总结的比较好
