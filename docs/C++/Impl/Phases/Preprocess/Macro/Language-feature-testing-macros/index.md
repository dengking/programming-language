# [Replacing text macros](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/preprocessor/replace) # [Language feature-testing macros](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/preprocessor/replace#Language_feature-testing_macros) (since C++20)

The standard defines a set of preprocessor macros corresponding to C++ language features introduced in C++11 or later. They are intended as a simple and portable way to detect the presence of said features.

See [cpp/feature_test](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/feature_test) for details.
