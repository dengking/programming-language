## `__cplusplus`

denotes the version of C++ standard that is being used, expands to value :

199711L(until C++11), 

201103L(C++11), 

201402L(C++14), 

201703L(C++17), or 

202002L(C++20) (macro constant)

> NOTE: 

## `__STDC_HOSTED__`(C++11)

expands to the integer constant 1 if the implementation is hosted (runs under an OS), 0 if freestanding (runs without an OS) (macro constant)

## `__FILE__`  and`__LINE__`

expands to the name of the current file, as a character string literal, can be changed by the [`#line`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/preprocessor/line) directive (macro constant)

expands to the source file line number, an integer constant, can be changed by the [`#line`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/preprocessor/line) directive (macro constant)

## `__DATE__` and `__TIME__`

expands to the date of translation, a character string literal of the form "Mmm dd yyyy". The first character of "dd" is a space if the day of the month is less than 10. The name of the month is as if generated by [std::asctime](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/c/asctime)() (macro constant)

expands to the time of translation, a character string literal of the form "hh:mm:ss" (macro constant)



## `__STDCPP_DEFAULT_NEW_ALIGNMENT__`(C++17)

expands to an [std::size_t](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/size_t) literal whose value is the alignment guaranteed by a call to alignment-unaware [operator new](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_new) (larger alignments will be passed to alignment-aware overload, such as [operator new](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_new)([std::size_t](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/size_t), [std::align_val_t](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/align_val_t)) (macro constant)
