# [Itanium C++ ABI](https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/)

> 这是被广泛采用的一种ABI

The Itanium C++ ABI is an ABI for C++. As an ABI, it gives precise rules for implementing the language, ensuring that separately-compiled parts of a program can successfully interoperate. Although it was initially developed for the Itanium architecture, it is not **platform-specific** and can be layered portably on top of an arbitrary C ABI. Accordingly, it is used as the standard C++ ABI for many major operating systems on all major architectures, and is implemented in many major C++ compilers, including GCC and Clang.
