# [Application binary interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface)

In [computer software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software), an **application binary interface** (**ABI**) is an [interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)) between two **binary program modules**; often, one of these modules is a [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) or [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) facility, and the other is a program that is being run by a user.

An *ABI* defines how data structures or computational routines are accessed in [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code), which is a low-level, hardware-dependent format; in contrast, an [*API*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) defines this access in [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code), which is a relatively high-level, hardware-independent, often [human-readable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-readable) format. A common aspect of an ABI is the [calling convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention), which determines how data is provided as input to or read as output from computational routines; examples are the [x86 calling conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions).

Adhering to an ABI (which may or may not be officially standardized) is usually the job of a [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler), operating system, or library author; however, an application programmer may have to deal with an ABI directly when writing a program in a mix of programming languages, which can be achieved by using [foreign function calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_call).

## Description

ABIs cover details such as:

- a processor instruction set (with details like register file structure, stack organization, memory access types, ...)
- the sizes, layouts, and [alignments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment) of basic [data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type) that the processor can directly access
- the [calling convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention), which controls how [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(programming))' arguments are passed and return values are retrieved; for example, whether all parameters are passed on the stack or some are passed in **registers**, which registers are used for which function parameters, and whether the first function parameter passed on the stack is pushed first or last onto the stack
- how an application should make [system calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call) to the operating system and, if the ABI specifies **direct system calls** rather than **procedure calls** to system call stubs, the **system call numbers**
- and in the case of a complete operating system ABI, the binary format of [object files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_file), program libraries and so on.

## Complete ABIs

A complete ABI, such as the [Intel Binary Compatibility Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Binary_Compatibility_Standard) (iBCS), allows a program from one operating system supporting that ABI to run without modifications on any other such system, provided that necessary shared libraries are present, and similar prerequisites are fulfilled.

Other[*which?*] ABIs standardize details such as the [C++ name mangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling#Name_mangling_in_C++),  [exception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling) propagation, and calling convention between compilers on the same platform, but do not require cross-platform compatibility.

## Embedded ABIs

An *embedded-application binary interface* (EABI) specifies standard conventions for [file formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format), data types, register usage, [stack frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_frame) organization, and function parameter passing of an [embedded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system) software program, for use with an [embedded operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_operating_system).

[Compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) that support the EABI create [object code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_code) that is compatible with code generated by other such compilers, allowing developers to link libraries generated with one compiler with object code generated with another compiler. Developers writing their own [assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) code may also interface with assembly generated by a compliant compiler.

EABIs are designed to optimize for performance within the limited resources of an embedded system. Therefore, EABIs omit most abstractions that are made between kernel and user code in complex operating systems. For example, dynamic linking is avoided to allow smaller executables and faster loading, fixed register usage allows more compact stacks and kernel calls, and running the application in privileged mode allows direct access to custom hardware operation without the indirection of calling a device driver. [[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface#cite_note-ppc-eabi-4) The choice of EABI can affect performance.[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface#cite_note-5)[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface#cite_note-6)

Widely used EABIs include [PowerPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC),[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface#cite_note-ppc-eabi-4) [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture) EABI2[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface#cite_note-7) and [MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture) EABI.[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface#cite_note-8)





## [Difference between API and ABI](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3784389/difference-between-api-and-abi)

Q:

I am new to linux system programming and I came across API and ABI while reading **Linux System Programming**.

**Definition of API :**

> An API defines the interfaces by which one piece of software communicates with another at the source level.

**Definition of ABI :**

> Whereas an API defines a source interface, an ABI defines the **low-level binary interface** between two or more pieces of software on a particular architecture. It defines how an application interacts with itself, how an application interacts with the **kernel**, and how an application interacts with **libraries**.

How can a program communicate at a source level ? What is a source level ? Is it related to source code in anyway? Or the source of the library gets included in the main program ?

The only difference I know is API is mostly used by programmers and ABI is mostly used by compiler.

A:

by source level they mean something like **include file** to expose function definitions â€“ [Anycorn](https://stackoverflow.com/users/206328/anycorn)

[A](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3784697):

### API: Application Program Interface

This is the set of public types/variables/functions that you expose from your application/library.

In C/C++ this is what you expose in the header files that you ship with the application.

### ABI: Application Binary Interface

This is how the compiler builds an application.
It defines things (but is not limited to):

- How parameters are passed to functions (registers/stack).
- Who cleans parameters from the stack (caller/callee).
- Where the return value is placed for return.
- How exceptions propagate.
