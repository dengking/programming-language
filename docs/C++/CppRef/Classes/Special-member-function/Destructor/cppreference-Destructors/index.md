# cppreference [Destructors](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/destructor)

 A destructor is a special [member function](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/member_functions) that is called when the [lifetime of an object](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lifetime) ends. The purpose of the destructor is to free the resources that the object may have acquired during its lifetime.

1) Typical declaration of a destructor

2) **Virtual destructor** is usually required in a **base class**

3) Forcing a **destructor** to be generated by the compiler

4) Disabling the **implicit destructor**

5) Formal syntax of a destructor declaration

| decl-specifier-seq | -    | `friend`, `inline`, `virtual`, or nothing (no return type)   |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| id-expression      | -    | within a **class definition**, the symbol `**~**` followed by the **class name**. Within a class template, the symbol `**~**` followed by the name of the current instantiation of the template. At namespace scope or in a [friend](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/friend) declaration within a different class, *nested-name-specifier* followed by the symbol `**~**` followed by the class name which is the same class as the one named by the nested-name-specifier. In any case, the name must be the actual name of the class or template, and not a `typedef`. The entire id-expression may be surrounded by parentheses which do not change its meaning. |
| attr(C++11)        | -    | optional sequence of any number of [attributes](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/attributes) |
| except             | -    | exception specification as in any function declaration (either [dynamic exception specification](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/except_spec)(deprecated)(removed in C++17) or [noexcept specification](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/noexcept_spec)(C++11))Except that if no exception specification is explicitly provided, the exception specification is considered to be one that would be used by the implicitly-declared destructor (see below). In most cases, this is noexcept(true). Thus a throwing destructor must be explicitly declared noexcept(false).(since C++11) |
