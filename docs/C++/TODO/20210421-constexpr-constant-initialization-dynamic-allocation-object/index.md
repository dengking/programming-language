The future looks bright, however. Even when moving slowly, smart people have been working on several proposals to augment the capabilities of `constexpr` to types like `std::string` or `std::vector`. The idea here is to allow for memory allocations at compile time and later flash the object alongside its managed memory into the data section of the binary.
