This is automated checker to make sure a C++ file follows Google's C++ style guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). As it heavily relies on regular expressions, cpplint.py won't catch all violations of the style guide and will very occasionally report a false positive. There is a list of things we currently don't handle very well at the top of cpplint.py,
and we welcome patches to improve it.
