learncpp [std::shared_ptr](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/15-6-stdshared_ptr/)：

> Unlike std::unique_ptr, which uses a single pointer internally, std::shared_ptr uses two pointers internally. One pointer points at the resource being managed. The other points at a “control block”, which is a dynamically allocated object that tracks of a bunch of stuff, including how many std::shared_ptr are pointing at the resource. When a std::shared_ptr is created via a std::shared_ptr constructor, the memory for the managed object (which is usually passed in) and control block (which the constructor creates) are allocated separately. However, when using std::make_shared(), this can be optimized into a single memory allocation, which leads to better performance.
>
> This also explains why independently creating two std::shared_ptr pointed to the same resource gets us into trouble. Each std::shared_ptr will have one pointer pointing at the resource. However, each std::shared_ptr will independently allocate its own control block, which will indicate that it is the only pointer owning that resource. Thus, when that std::shared_ptr goes out of scope, it will deallocate the resource, not realizing there are other std::shared_ptr also trying to manage that resource.
>
> However, when a std::shared_ptr is cloned using copy assignment, the data in the control block can be appropriately updated to indicate that there are now additional std::shared_ptr co-managing the resource.



### Implementation 1

http://www.josuttis.com/libbook/cont/countptr.hpp.html

```c++
#ifndef COUNTED_PTR_HPP
#define COUNTED_PTR_HPP

/* class for counted reference semantics
 * - deletes the object to which it refers when the last CountedPtr
 *   that refers to it is destroyed
 */
template <class T>
class CountedPtr {
  private:
    T* ptr;        // pointer to the value
    long* count;   // shared number of owners

  public:
    // initialize pointer with existing pointer
    // - requires that the pointer p is a return value of new
    explicit CountedPtr (T* p=0)
     : ptr(p), count(new long(1)) {
    }

    // copy pointer (one more owner)
    CountedPtr (const CountedPtr<T>& p) throw()
     : ptr(p.ptr), count(p.count) {
        ++*count;
    }

    // destructor (delete value if this was the last owner)
    ~CountedPtr () throw() {
        dispose();
    }

    // assignment (unshare old and share new value)
    CountedPtr<T>& operator= (const CountedPtr<T>& p) throw() {
        if (this != &p) {
            dispose();
            ptr = p.ptr;
            count = p.count;
            ++*count;
        }
        return *this;
    }

    // access the value to which the pointer refers
    T& operator*() const throw() {
        return *ptr;
    }
    T* operator->() const throw() {
        return ptr;
    }

  private:
    void dispose() {
        if (--*count == 0) {
             delete count;
             delete ptr;
        }
    }
    
};

#endif /*COUNTED_PTR_HPP*/
```

### `std::shared_ptr` thread_safety

综合stackoverflow [std::shared_ptr thread safety explained](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9127816/stdshared-ptr-thread-safety-explained)、cppreference [`std::shared_ptr`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr) 、[Boost.SmartPtr: The Smart Pointer Library](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/smart_ptr/doc/html/smart_ptr.html)中的描述可知：

- Standard guarantees that reference counting is handled thread safe and it's platform independent
- standard guarantees that only one thread (holding last reference) will call delete on shared object
- `shared_ptr` does not guarantee any thread safety for object stored in it

#### cppreference [`std::shared_ptr`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr) 

> All member functions (including copy constructor and copy assignment) can be called by multiple threads on different instances of `shared_ptr` without additional synchronization even if these instances are copies and share ownership of the same object. If multiple threads of execution access the same `shared_ptr` without synchronization and any of those accesses uses a non-const member function of `shared_ptr` then a data race will occur; the [`shared_ptr` overloads of atomic functions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr/atomic) can be used to prevent the data race.

上面这段话其实描述了两种情况：

- 多个thread同时使用同一个`shared_ptr` instance，此时是需要synchronization 
- 多个thread，每个thread有一个自己的`shared_ptr` instance，这些instance执行同一个object

#### stackoverflow [std::shared_ptr thread safety explained](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9127816/stdshared-ptr-thread-safety-explained)

I'm reading http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/shared_ptr.html and some thread safety issues are still not clear for me:

1. Standard guarantees that reference counting is handled thread safe and it's platform independent, right?
2. Similar issue - standard guarantees that only one thread (holding last reference) will call delete on shared object, right?
3. `shared_ptr` does not guarantee any thread safety for object stored in it?

Pseudo code:

```cpp
// Thread I
shared_ptr<A> a (new A (1));

// Thread II
shared_ptr<A> b (a);

// Thread III
shared_ptr<A> c (a);

// Thread IV
shared_ptr<A> d (a);

d.reset (new A (10));
```

As others have pointed out, you've got it figured out correctly regarding your original 3 questions.

But the ending part of your edit

> Calling reset() in thread IV will delete previous instance of A class created in first thread and replace it with new instance? Moreover after calling reset() in IV thread other threads will see only newly created object?

is incorrect. Only `d` will point to the new `A(10)`, and `a`, `b`, and `c` will continue to point to the original `A(1)`. This can be seen clearly in the following short example.

[A](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9133225)

Correct, `shared_ptr`s use atomic increments/decrements of a reference count value.
