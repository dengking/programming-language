# Eiffel

在[**LLVM**](https://llvm.org/) 中提及，“LLVM has been awarded the **2012 ACM Software System Award**!”，于是我查看了[ACM Software System Award](https://awards.acm.org/software-system/award-winners)，无意中发现2006年，该奖授予给了[Bertrand Meyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Meyer)

> For designing and developing the Eiffel programming language, method and environment, embodying the Design by Contract approach to software development and other features that facilitate the construction of reliable, extendible and efficient software.

于是我发现了这门语言。
