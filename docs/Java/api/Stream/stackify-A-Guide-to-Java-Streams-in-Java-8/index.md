## Introduction

First of all, Java 8 Streams should not be confused with Java I/O streams (ex: *FileInputStream* etc); these have very little to do with each other.

Simply put, streams are wrappers around a data source, allowing us to operate with that data source and making bulk processing convenient and fast.

A stream does not store data and, in that sense, is not a data structure. It also never modifies the underlying data source.

This functionality – *java.util.stream* – supports functional-style operations on streams of elements, such as map-reduce transformations on collections.
