# Collections



## Java's Collections Framework

**Java's Collections Framework** is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections of objects. It provides a set of interfaces, implementations, and algorithms that allow developers to work with groups of objects in a consistent manner. The framework is part of the Java Standard Library and was introduced in Java 2 (Java 1.2).

### Key Components of the Collections Framework

1. **Interfaces**: The core of the Collections Framework consists of several key interfaces that define the behavior of different types of collections. The most important interfaces include:

   - **Collection**: The root interface in the collection hierarchy. It represents a group of objects known as elements.
   - **List**: An ordered collection (also known as a sequence) that allows duplicate elements. Common implementations include `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`.
   - **Set**: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements. Common implementations include `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, and `TreeSet`.
   - **Map**: An object that maps keys to values, where each key is unique. Common implementations include `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, and `TreeMap`.
   - **Queue**: A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. It typically orders elements in a FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner. Common implementations include `LinkedList` and `PriorityQueue`.
   - **Deque**: A double-ended queue that allows elements to be added or removed from both ends. The `ArrayDeque` and `LinkedList` classes implement this interface.

2. **Implementations**: The framework provides various concrete classes that implement the collection interfaces. Some of the most commonly used implementations include:

   - **ArrayList**: A resizable array implementation of the `List` interface. It provides fast random access and is efficient for adding elements at the end.
   - **LinkedList**: A doubly-linked list implementation of the `List` and `Deque` interfaces. It is efficient for inserting and removing elements from the beginning or end.
   - **HashSet**: A hash table-based implementation of the `Set` interface. It provides constant-time performance for basic operations (add, remove, contains).
   - **TreeSet**: A sorted set implementation that uses a red-black tree. It maintains elements in their natural order or according to a specified comparator.
   - **HashMap**: A hash table-based implementation of the `Map` interface. It allows for fast retrieval of values based on keys.
   - **TreeMap**: A sorted map implementation that maintains its entries in ascending key order.

3. **Algorithms**: The Collections Framework provides a set of algorithms that can be applied to collections, such as sorting and searching. These algorithms are defined in the `Collections` utility class, which contains static methods for operations like `sort()`, `shuffle()`, `reverse()`, and `binarySearch()`.

### Benefits of the Collections Framework

- **Unified Architecture**: The framework provides a consistent way to work with different types of collections, making it easier to learn and use.
- **Reusability**: The framework promotes code reuse through its interfaces and implementations, allowing developers to use existing classes without having to implement their own.
- **Performance**: The various implementations are optimized for different use cases, allowing developers to choose the most appropriate collection type based on their performance needs.
- **Flexibility**: The framework supports generics, allowing collections to be type-safe and reducing the need for casting.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating the use of some collections in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CollectionsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using ArrayList
        List<String> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();
        arrayList.add("Apple");
        arrayList.add("Banana");
        arrayList.add("Cherry");
        System.out.println("ArrayList: " + arrayList);

        // Using HashSet
        Set<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();
        hashSet.add("Apple");
        hashSet.add("Banana");
        hashSet.add("Apple"); // Duplicate, will not be added
        System.out.println("HashSet: " + hashSet);

        // Using HashMap
        Map<String, Integer> hashMap = new HashMap<>();
        hashMap.put("Apple", 1);
        hashMap.put("Banana", 2);
        hashMap.put("Cherry", 3);
        System.out.println("HashMap: " + hashMap);

        // Using TreeSet
        Set<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
        treeSet.add("Banana");
        treeSet.add("Apple");
        treeSet.add("Cherry");
        System.out.println("TreeSet (sorted): " + treeSet);

        // Using Collections utility class
        Collections.sort(arrayList);
        System.out.println("Sorted
