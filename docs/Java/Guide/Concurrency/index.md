## java concurrent programming book

If you're looking for books on Java concurrent programming, there are several excellent resources that cover various aspects of concurrency, threading, and parallelism in Java. Here are some highly recommended books:

### 1. **"Java Concurrency in Practice" by Brian Goetz**
   - **Overview**: This is one of the most well-known books on concurrency in Java. It covers the principles of concurrent programming, the Java memory model, and best practices for writing thread-safe code. The book also discusses common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
   - **Key Topics**: Thread safety, synchronization, concurrent collections, atomic variables, and design patterns for concurrent programming.

### 2. **"Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch (3rd Edition)**
   - **Overview**: While not exclusively about concurrency, this book contains a section dedicated to concurrency that provides best practices and guidelines for writing concurrent code in Java. It’s a must-read for any Java developer.
   - **Key Topics**: Thread safety, immutability, and the use of the `java.util.concurrent` package.

### 3. **"Concurrency in Practice" by Doug Lea**
   - **Overview**: Doug Lea is a key figure in the development of the Java concurrency framework. This book provides a deep dive into concurrent programming concepts and the design of concurrent algorithms. It’s more technical and is suitable for readers who want to understand the underlying principles of concurrency.
   - **Key Topics**: Thread pools, futures, concurrent collections, and the design of concurrent algorithms.

### 4. **"Java Concurrency" by Scott Oaks**
   - **Overview**: This book provides a comprehensive overview of the Java concurrency framework, including the `java.util.concurrent` package. It covers both the theory and practical aspects of concurrent programming in Java.
   - **Key Topics**: Thread management, synchronization, locks, and concurrent data structures.

### 5. **"Java Threads" by Scott Oaks and Henry Wong**
   - **Overview**: This book focuses on the basics of threading in Java, including thread lifecycle, synchronization, and inter-thread communication. It’s a good starting point for those new to Java concurrency.
   - **Key Topics**: Thread creation, synchronization, and thread-safe programming.

### 6. **"Java 8 in Action" by Raoul-Gabriel Urma, Mario Fusco, and Alan Mycroft**
   - **Overview**: This book covers Java 8 features, including the new concurrency features introduced in Java 8, such as the `CompletableFuture` class and the Streams API. It’s a great resource for understanding modern Java programming practices.
   - **Key Topics**: Functional programming, parallel streams, and asynchronous programming with `CompletableFuture`.

### 7. **"Mastering Concurrency in Java 9" by Javier Fernández González**
   - **Overview**: This book focuses on the concurrency features introduced in Java 9 and later versions. It covers advanced topics such as reactive programming and the new APIs for asynchronous programming.
   - **Key Topics**: Reactive programming, the `CompletableFuture` API, and the new concurrency features in Java 9.

### 8. **"Java Concurrency: The Java™ Tutorials" by Oracle**
   - **Overview**: This is an online resource provided by Oracle that covers the basics of concurrency in Java. It’s a good starting point for beginners and is freely available.
   - **Key Topics**: Thread basics, synchronization, and the `java.util.concurrent` package.

### Conclusion

These books provide a solid foundation in Java concurrent programming, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Depending on your current knowledge level and specific interests, you can choose a book that best fits your needs. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, these resources will help you understand and effectively use concurrency in Java.
