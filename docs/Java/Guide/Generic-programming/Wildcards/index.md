# Java Wildcards



## docs.oracle [Wildcards](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/wildcards.html) 

In generic code, the question mark (`?`), called the *wildcard*, represents an unknown type. The **wildcard** can be used in a variety of situations: 

- as the type of a parameter,
- field, 
- or local variable; 
- sometimes as a return type (though it is better programming practice to be more specific). 

The wildcard is never used as a type argument for a **generic method invocation**, a **generic class instance creation**, or a **supertype**.

The following sections discuss wildcards in more detail, including **upper bounded wildcards**, **lower bounded wildcards**, and **wildcard capture**.

### [Unbounded Wildcards](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/unboundedWildcards.html)

The **unbounded wildcard type** is specified using the wildcard character (`?`), for example, `List<?>`. This is called a *list of unknown type*. There are two scenarios where an unbounded wildcard is a useful approach:

- If you are writing a method that can be implemented using functionality provided in the `Object` class.
- When the code is using methods in the generic class that don't depend on the type parameter. For example, `List.size` or `List.clear`. In fact, `Class<?>` is so often used because most of the methods in `Class<T>` do not depend on `T`.



Consider the following method, `printList`:

```java
public static void printList(List<Object> list) {
    for (Object elem : list)
        System.out.println(elem + " ");
    System.out.println();
}
```

The goal of `printList` is to print a list of any type, but it fails to achieve that goal â€” it prints only a list of `Object` instances; it cannot print `List<Integer>`, `List<String>`, `List<Double>`, and so on, because they are not subtypes of `List<Object>`. To write a generic `printList` method, use `List<?>`:

```java
public static void printList(List<?> list) {
    for (Object elem: list)
        System.out.print(elem + " ");
    System.out.println();
}
```



### [Upper Bounded Wildcards](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/upperBounded.html)

You can use an upper bounded wildcard to relax the restrictions on a variable. For example, say you want to write a method that works on `List<Integer>`, `List<Double>`, *and* `List<Number>`; you can achieve this by using an upper bounded wildcard.

To declare an upper-bounded wildcard, use the wildcard character ('`?`'), followed by the `extends` keyword, followed by its *upper bound*. Note that, in this context, `extends` is used in a general sense to mean either "extends" (as in classes) or "implements" (as in interfaces).

To write the method that works on lists of `Number` and the subtypes of `Number`, such as `Integer`, `Double`, and `Float`, you would specify `List<? extends Number>`. The term `List<Number>` is more restrictive than `List<? extends Number>` because the former matches a list of type `Number` only, whereas the latter matches a list of type `Number` or any of its subclasses.



### [Lower Bounded Wildcards](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/lowerBounded.html)

The [Upper Bounded Wildcards](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/upperBounded.html) section shows that an upper bounded wildcard restricts the unknown type to be a specific type or a subtype of that type and is represented using the `extends` keyword. In a similar way, a *lower bounded* wildcard restricts the unknown type to be a specific type or a *super type* of that type.

A lower bounded wildcard is expressed using the wildcard character ('`?`'), following by the `super` keyword, followed by its *lower bound*: `<? super A>`.



### [Wildcards and Subtyping](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/subtyping.html) 

As described in [Generics, Inheritance, and Subtypes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/inheritance.html), generic classes or interfaces are not related merely because there is a relationship between their types. However, you can use wildcards to create a relationship between generic classes or interfaces.

Given the following two regular (non-generic) classes:

```java
class A { /* ... */ }
class B extends A { /* ... */ }
```

It would be reasonable to write the following code:

```java
B b = new B();
A a = b;
```

This example shows that inheritance of regular classes follows this rule of subtyping: class `B` is a subtype of class `A` if `B` extends `A`. This rule does not apply to generic types:

```java
List<B> lb = new ArrayList<>();
List<A> la = lb;   // compile-time error
```

Given that `Integer` is a subtype of `Number`, what is the relationship between `List<Integer>` and `List<Number>`?

![diagram showing that the common parent of List<Number> and List<Integer> is the list of unknown type](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/figures/java/generics-listParent.gif)

The common parent is `List<?>`.

Although `Integer` is a subtype of `Number`, `List<Integer>` is not a subtype of `List<Number>` and, in fact, these two types are not related. The common parent of `List<Number>` and `List<Integer>` is `List<?>`.

In order to create a relationship between these classes so that the code can access `Number`'s methods through `List<Integer>`'s elements, use an upper bounded wildcard:

```java
List<? extends Integer> intList = new ArrayList<>();
List<? extends Number>  numList = intList;  // OK. List<? extends Integer> is a subtype of List<? extends Number>
```
