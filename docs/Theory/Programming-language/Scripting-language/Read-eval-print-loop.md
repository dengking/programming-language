# [Read–eval–print loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)

A **read–eval–print loop** (**REPL**), also termed an **interactive toplevel** or **language shell**, is a simple, interactive [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) environment that takes single user inputs (i.e., single [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science))), evaluates (executes) them, and returns the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise. The term is usually used to refer to programming interfaces similar to the classic [Lisp machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine) interactive environment. Common examples include [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line_interface) [shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) and similar environments for [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language), and the technique is very characteristic of [scripting languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language).
