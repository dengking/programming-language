## [The Boost Graph Library (BGL)](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_73_0/libs/graph/doc/)

> custom-made (or even legacy) graph structures can be used as-is with the generic graph algorithms of the BGL, using *external adaptation* (see Section [How to Convert Existing Graphs to the BGL](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_73_0/libs/graph/doc/leda_conversion.html)). External adaptation wraps a new interface around a data-structure without copying and without placing the data inside adaptor objects. The BGL interface was carefully designed to make this adaptation easy.
