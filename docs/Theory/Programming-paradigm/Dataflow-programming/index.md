# Dataflow programming

在学习TensorFlow时，知道他是基于dataflow architecture的，所以对Dataflow programming进行了一些了解。

## wikipedia [Dataflow programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming)

In computer programming, **dataflow programming** is a programming paradigm that models a program as a **directed graph** of the data flowing between operations, thus implementing dataflow principles and architecture. Dataflow programming languages share some features of functional languages, and were generally developed in order to bring some functional concepts to a language more suitable for numeric processing. Some authors use the term datastream instead of dataflow to avoid confusion with dataflow computing or dataflow architecture, based on an indeterministic machine paradigm. Dataflow programming was pioneered by Jack Dennis and his graduate students at MIT in the 1960s.

> NOTE: TensorFlow就是典型的基于dataflow的。TensorFlow中的directed graph被称为computational graph。

## Dataflow and stream

dataflow其实就是一种stream，TensorFlow的中，显然它的stream的单位是tensor。关于stream，参见工程discrete的`Relation-structure-computation\Model\Stream`章节。
