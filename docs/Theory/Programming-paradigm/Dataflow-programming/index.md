# Dataflow programming

在学习TensorFlow时，知道他是基于dataflow architecture的，所以对Dataflow programming进行了一些了解。

## wikipedia [Dataflow programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming)

In [computer programming](https://infogalactic.com/info/Computer_programming), **dataflow programming** is a [programming paradigm](https://infogalactic.com/info/Programming_paradigm) that models a program as a [directed graph](https://infogalactic.com/info/Directed_graph) of the data flowing between operations, thus implementing [dataflow](https://infogalactic.com/info/Dataflow) principles and architecture. 

> NOTE: TensorFlow就是典型的基于dataflow的。TensorFlow中的directed graph被称为computational graph。

Dataflow [programming languages](https://infogalactic.com/info/Programming_language) share some features of [functional languages](https://infogalactic.com/info/Functional_language), and were generally developed in order to bring some functional concepts to a language more suitable for **numeric processing**.

> NOTE: 本段所讨论的是dataflow language 和 functional language。

Some authors use the term Datastream instead of [Dataflow](https://infogalactic.com/info/Dataflow) to avoid confusion with Dataflow Computing or [Dataflow architecture](https://infogalactic.com/info/Dataflow_architecture), based on an indeterministic machine paradigm. 

Dataflow programming was pioneered by [Jack Dennis](https://infogalactic.com/info/Jack_Dennis) and his graduate students at MIT in the 1960s.

## Dataflow and stream

dataflow其实就是一种stream，TensorFlow的中，显然它的stream的单位是tensor。关于stream，参见工程discrete的`Relation-structure-computation\Model\Stream`章节。
