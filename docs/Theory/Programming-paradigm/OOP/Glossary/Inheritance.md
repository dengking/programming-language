# Inheritance 



## wikipedia [Inheritance (object-oriented programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming))

Inheritance should not be confused with [subtyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping).[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)#cite_note-3)[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)#cite_note-4) In some languages inheritance and subtyping agree,[[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)#cite_note-5) whereas in others they differ; in general, subtyping establishes an [is-a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is-a) relationship, whereas inheritance only reuses implementation and establishes a syntactic relationship, not necessarily a semantic relationship (inheritance does not ensure [behavioral subtyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_subtyping)). To distinguish these concepts, subtyping is also known as *interface inheritance*, whereas inheritance as defined here is known as *implementation inheritance* or *code inheritance*.[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)#cite_note-Mikhajlov-6) Still, inheritance is a commonly used mechanism for establishing subtype relationships.[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)#cite_note-7)
