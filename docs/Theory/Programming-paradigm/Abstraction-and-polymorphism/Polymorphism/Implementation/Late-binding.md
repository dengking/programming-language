# Late binding



## wikipedia [Late binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_binding)

**Late binding**, **dynamic binding**,[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_binding#cite_note-1) or **dynamic linkage**[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_binding#cite_note-2)—though not an identical process to [dynamically linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_linker) imported code libraries—is a computer programming mechanism in which the method being called upon an object, or the function being called with arguments, is looked up by name at [runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase)). In other words, a name is associated with a particular operation or object at runtime, rather than during compilation.
