# [Delegation (object-oriented programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_(object-oriented_programming))

In [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), **delegation** refers to evaluating a member (property or method) of one object (the receiver) in the context of another original object (the **sender**). **Delegation** can be done explicitly, by passing the **sending object** to the **receiving object**, which can be done in any [object-oriented language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_language); or implicitly, by the **member lookup rules** of the language, which requires language support for the feature. **Implicit delegation** is the fundamental method for behavior reuse in [prototype-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming), corresponding to [inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)) in [class-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_programming)（这里是使用类比方法进行描述）. The best-known languages that support delegation at the language level are [Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(programming_language)), which incorporates（合并） the notion of **delegation** through its notion of **mutable parent slots** that are used upon method lookup on self calls, and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript); see [JavaScript delegation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Delegative).

The term *delegation* is also used loosely for various other relationships between objects; see [delegation (programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_(programming)) for more. Frequently confused concepts are simply using another object, more precisely referred to as *consultation* or *aggregation*; and evaluating a member on one object by evaluating the corresponding member on another object, notably in the context of the receiving object, which is more precisely referred to as *forwarding* (when a wrapper object doesn't pass itself to the wrapped object).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_(object-oriented_programming)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGammaHelmJohnsonVlissides1995%22Delegation%22,_pp._20%E2%80%9321-1)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_(object-oriented_programming)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBeck1997%22Delegation%22,_pp._64%E2%80%9369-2)[[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_(object-oriented_programming)#cite_note-3) The [delegation pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern) is a [software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) for implementing delegation, though this term is also used loosely for consultation or forwarding.

总结：I have read this article roughly and found that except for the first paragraph, the rest of the content does not have much value.
