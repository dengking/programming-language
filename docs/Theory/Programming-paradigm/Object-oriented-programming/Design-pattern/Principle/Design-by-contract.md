# Design by contract



## 维基百科[Design by contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract)

**Design by contract** (**DbC**), also known as **contract programming**, **programming by contract** and **design-by-contract programming**, is an approach for [designing software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design).

It prescribes that software designers should define [formal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods), precise and verifiable interface specifications for [software components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering#Software_component), which extend the ordinary definition of [abstract data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) with [preconditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precondition), [postconditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcondition) and [invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(computer_science)). These specifications are referred to as "contracts", in accordance with a [conceptual metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor) with the conditions and obligations of business contracts.
