# Creational pattern



## 维基百科[Creational pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern)

Creational design patterns are composed of two dominant ideas. One is encapsulating knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses. Another is hiding how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern#cite_note-1)

> NOTE: “encapsulating knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses”其实就是将encapsulate implementation，它所蕴含的是["Program to an 'interface', not an '**implementation'**." (Gang of Four 1995:18)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns#Introduction,_Chapter_1)
