# Object-oriented programming

本文主要基于维基百科[Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)，维基百科的这篇文章总结地还可以，如果有一定的编程经验的话，可以较好理解。如果没有OOP的经验，可以阅读下一章[Thinking-in-java](./Thinking-in-java/index.md)，其中对OOP理论有非常好的描述。

## 维基百科[Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)

**Object-oriented programming** (**OOP**) is a [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) based on the concept of "[objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science))", which can contain [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data), in the form of [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(computer_science)) (often known as *attributes* or *properties*), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as *[methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_science))*). A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "[this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_(computer_programming))" or "self"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.

[OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are [class-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_programming), meaning that objects are [instances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)) of [classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_science)), which also determine their [types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type).
