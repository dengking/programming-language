# First-class function



## Wikipedia [First-class function](https://infogalactic.com/info/First-class_function)

In [computer science](https://infogalactic.com/info/Computer_science), a [programming language](https://infogalactic.com/info/Programming_language) is said to have **first-class functions** if it treats [functions](https://infogalactic.com/info/Function_(programming)) as [first-class citizens](https://infogalactic.com/info/First-class_citizen). Specifically, this means the language supports passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning them as the values from other functions, and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures.[[1\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/First-class_function#cite_note-1) Some programming language theorists require support for [anonymous functions](https://infogalactic.com/info/Anonymous_function) (function literals) as well.[[2\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/First-class_function#cite_note-test-2) 

In languages with first-class functions, the [names](https://infogalactic.com/info/Name_(computer_science)) of functions do not have any special status; they are treated like ordinary [variables](https://infogalactic.com/info/Variable_(computer_science)) with a [function type](https://infogalactic.com/info/Function_type).[[3\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/First-class_function#cite_note-3) The term was coined by [Christopher Strachey](https://infogalactic.com/info/Christopher_Strachey) in the context of "functions as first-class citizens" in the mid-1960s.[[4\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/First-class_function#cite_note-strachey-4)

First-class functions are a necessity for the [functional programming](https://infogalactic.com/info/Functional_programming) style, in which the use of [higher-order functions](https://infogalactic.com/info/Higher-order_function) is a standard practice.

There are certain implementation difficulties in passing functions as arguments and returning them as results, especially in the presence of [non-local variables](https://infogalactic.com/info/Non-local_variable) introduced in [nested](https://infogalactic.com/info/Nested_function) and [anonymous functions](https://infogalactic.com/info/Anonymous_function). Historically, these were termed the [funarg problems](https://infogalactic.com/info/Funarg_problem), the name coming from "function argument".[[5\]](https://infogalactic.com/info/First-class_function#cite_note-5)
