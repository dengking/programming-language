# Higher-order function



## infogalactic [Higher-order function](https://infogalactic.com/info/Higher-order_function)

In [mathematics](https://infogalactic.com/info/Mathematics) and [computer science](https://infogalactic.com/info/Computer_science), a **higher-order function** (also **functional**, **functional form** or **functor**; not to be confused with the [functor](https://infogalactic.com/info/Functor) concept in [category theory](https://infogalactic.com/info/Category_theory)) is a [function](https://infogalactic.com/info/Function_(mathematics)) that does at least one of the following:

- takes one or more functions as arguments,
- returns a function as its result.

All other functions are *first-order functions*. 

In the [untyped lambda calculus](https://infogalactic.com/info/Lambda_calculus), all functions are higher-order; in a [typed lambda calculus](https://infogalactic.com/info/Typed_lambda_calculus), from which most [functional programming](https://infogalactic.com/info/Functional_programming) languages are derived, higher-order functions are values with types of the form ![(\tau_1\to\tau_2)\to\tau_3](https://infogalactic.com/w/images/math/c/a/6/ca67e9af1391034927199238107e65a0.png).
