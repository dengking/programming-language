# Partial application



## wikipedia [Partial application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application)

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), **partial application** (or **partial function application**) refers to the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller [arity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity). 



Intuitively, partial function application says "if you fix the first [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_science)) of the function, you get a function of the remaining arguments".
