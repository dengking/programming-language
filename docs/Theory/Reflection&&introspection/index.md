# Reflection and introspection

"reflection" 即 "反射"

"introspection" 即 "自省"

## Reflection VS introspection

通过 wikipedia [Reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)) 中的描述:

> In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), **reflection** is the ability of a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) to examine, [introspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection_(computer_science)), and modify its own structure and behavior at [runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase)).

可知，reflection 包括 introspection，它是一种比 introspection 更加强大的能力: "modify its own structure and behavior at [runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase))"
