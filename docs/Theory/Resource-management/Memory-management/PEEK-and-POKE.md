In [computing](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Computing), **PEEK and POKE** are commands used in some [high-level programming languages](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-High-level_programming_language) for accessing the contents of a specific memory cell referenced by its [memory address](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Memory_address). PEEK gets the byte located at the specified memory address.[[1\]](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Peek and Poke#cite_note-PEEK-1) POKE sets the memory byte at the specified address.[[2\]](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Peek and Poke#cite_note-POKE-2) These commands originated with [machine code monitors](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Machine_code_monitor) such as the [DECsystem-10](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-PDP-10) monitor;[[3\]](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Peek and Poke#cite_note-3) these commands are particularly associated with the [BASIC](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-BASIC) programming language, though some other languages such as [Pascal](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Pascal_(programming_language)) and [COMAL](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-COMAL_(programming_language)) also have these commands. These commands are comparable in their roles to [pointers](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Pointer_(computer_programming)) in the [C language](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-C_(programming_language)) and some other programming languages.
