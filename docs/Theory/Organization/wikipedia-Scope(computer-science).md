# [Scope (computer science)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scoping)

In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), the **scope** of a [name binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_binding) – an association of a name to an entity, such as a [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(programming)) – is the region of a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) where the binding is valid: where the **name** can be used to refer to the **entity**. Such a **region** is referred to as a **scope block**. In other parts of the program the **name** may refer to a different **entity** (it may have a different binding), or to nothing at all (it may be unbound).

The scope of a binding is also known as the **visibility** of an **entity**, particularly in older or more technical literature – this is from the perspective of the **referenced entity**, not the **referencing name**. A **scope** is a part of a program that is or can be the scope for a set of bindings – a precise [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Definition) is tricky(棘手), but in casual use and in practice largely corresponds to a [block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(programming)), a function, or a file, depending on language and type of entity. The term "scope" is also used to refer to the set of *all* entities that are visible or names that are valid within a portion of the program or at a given point in a program, which is more correctly referred to as *context* or *environment*.[[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#cite_note-1)

Strictly speaking[[b\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#cite_note-2) and in practice for most programming languages, "part of a program" refers to "portion of the [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) (area of text)", and is known as **lexical scope**(词法范围). In some languages, however, "part of a program" refers to "portion of run time (time period during execution)", and is known as **dynamic scope**(动态范围). Both of these terms are somewhat misleading – they misuse technical terms, as discussed in the [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Definition) – but the distinction itself is accurate and precise, and these are the standard respective terms. **Lexical scope** is the main focus of this article, with **dynamic scope** understood by contrast with **lexical scope**.

In most cases, [name resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_resolution_(programming_languages)) based on **lexical scope** is relatively straightforward to use and to implement, as(因为) in use one can read backwards(向后读取) in the source code to determine to which entity a **name** refers, and in implementation one can maintain a list of names and contexts when compiling or interpreting a program. Difficulties arise in [name masking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_masking), [forward declarations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_declaration), and [hoisting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_hoisting), while considerably subtler ones arise with [non-local variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-local_variable), particularly in [closures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)).

思考：通过identifier来refer object，那就出现这样的问题：哪些地方可以使用这个identifier；如果从name binding的角度来看的话，哪些地方可以binding，
