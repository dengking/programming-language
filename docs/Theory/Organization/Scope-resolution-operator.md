## wikipedia [Scope resolution operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_resolution_operator)

In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), [scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)) is an enclosing context where [values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science)) and [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)) are associated. The **scope resolution operator** helps to identify and specify the context to which an [identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier_(computer_languages)) refers, particularly by specifying a [namespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace). The specific uses vary across different [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) with the notions of scoping. In many languages, the scope resolution operator is written `::`.
