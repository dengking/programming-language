# Duck typing

## wikipedia [Duck test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test)

The **duck test** is a form of [abductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning)(翻译推理). This is its usual expression:

> If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably *is* a duck.

The test implies that a person can identify an unknown subject by observing that subject's habitual characteristics. It is sometimes used to counter abstruse arguments that something is not what it appears to be.

**Duck typing** in computer programming is an application of the [duck test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test)—"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"—to determine if an [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)) can be used for a particular purpose. With normal typing, **suitability** is determined by an **object's type**. In duck typing, an object's **suitability** is determined by the presence of **certain [methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)) and properties**, rather than the type of the object itself.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing#cite_note-1)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing#cite_note-2)
